# About
This repo conatins a recepie for creating Kaldi language models from a few data sources. The goal is to create to develop Kaldi models for voice control and question answering systems for Icelandic. Voice control refers to a one-way communication between human and system with the aim of soliciting an action. From an ASR perspective, this requires a special attention to the type of language modelling as the utterance might not adhere to normal rules of continuous language. ASR for question answering has a similar design criteria with the specialized utterance structure being in the form of questions.
